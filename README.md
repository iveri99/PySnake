# PySnake

Originally was creating a 2D Tron Game but decided that I was getting ahead of myself, so then decided to work on a Snake game instead. This means that I can focus on implementing one player as opposed to two, and not have to create an AI as the second player. 

The experience from building the snake game will directly transfer to the tron game, as the mechanics and logic for both are very similar.
