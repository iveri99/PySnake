A score-counter in the corner of the screen, that increments each time the snake eats food and grows in size.
Allows the player to try again if they lose.

### Setup

Copy this code and run it in any terminal that has Python installed.
Ensure that you have installed the PyGame library into the terminal.


### Reflection

This was my first time coding in an object-oriented manner, and had only learned all the basic concepts like classes/objects/methods/attributes a few days before.
Therefore, it proved to be a struggle initally, as I was pushed out of my comfort zone. I found myself needing to constantly search for answers online on places like StackOverflow, and even though it is a part of every programmers workflow, I still had a problem with it as I aspire to be able to produce projects without an overreliance on external sources.

I quickly learned to adapt to the new coding methodolgies and the process behind development using objects, and I am now actively encouraging myself to use as much of my problem solving skills as possible as opposed to a google search or tutorial, in order to tackle any challenges I face while coding.
